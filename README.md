# Polish-cow
# BIG THANKS TO edelwiw

This is a simple Arduino project that can make a cow move and sing a strange Polish song. To repeat this, you will need :
1. Arduino pro mini because it small
2. Amplifier
3. Speaker 28mm in diameter
4. Button
5. Servo SG 90/92R and others with the same dimensions
6. BMS TP4056 Type-c 
7. Li-Ion battery (optional)

# Connect components to arduino

You should attach servo to 8 digital pin, amplifier to 9 digital pin, button to 5 pin. If you want to add battery you can connect transistor to 7 pin.
